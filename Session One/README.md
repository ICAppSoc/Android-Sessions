Suggested Tasks
---------------
1. Create a random name generator (with your own theme).
    - Suggestions:
        - Display the random name in a TextView.
        - Add a Button that re-generates a new random name every time it is clicked.
        - Use a RelativeLayout.
        - Choose a fun theme: fantasy character names, town names, app names, game names, etc.
    - Hints:
        - Use an array of common syllables/words, combine them randomly to create plausible names.
2. Create a text encryption / decryption app.
    - Suggestions:
        - Use two EditTexts and two TextViews.
        - Use a LinearLayout.
        - Typing into one EditText spits out encrypted text in one TextView.
        - Typing into the other EditText spits out decrypted text in the other TextView.
        - Pick your favorite cipher.
